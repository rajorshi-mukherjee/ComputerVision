This is a repository for all sorts of computer vision applications that I am learning from different sources

For starters I'm following along this free course from youtube on computer vision just to get the hang of the open cv library from the web. Link for the same is below.

Free Code Camp - OpenCV Course - Full Tutorial with Python

Current setup for this project is using python version 3.11.0

Check version using command python --version

I am using the following packages

https://pypi.org/project/opencv-contrib-python/
pip install opencv-contrib-python

and

https://pypi.org/project/caer/
pip install caer

This is all it took to set it up and currently working smoothly on 2 different systems.
